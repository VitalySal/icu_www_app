1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3
{ Diagram # This is a very popular system against the Slav - White avoids the main line of the Slav Defence (4.Nc3 dxc4), while in case of 4...e6 he can avoid the Meran Variation (5.Nc3 Nbd7 6.Bd3 dxc4 7.Bxc4 b5) by not developing the knight to c3 for a while. Veselin Topalov and Vladimir Kramnik contributed a lot to this system. }
4...Bg4

5.Qb3
{ White too has many plans. It's tempting to play 5.h3 Bh5 6.cxd5 cxd5 7.Qa4+, but Black can disarm this plan with 6...Bxf3, followed by 7...cxd5. He does that after the immediate 5.cxd5 too. White's plan usually involves hunting down the enemy light-squared bishop. }
