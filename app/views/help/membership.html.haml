%a{name: "subscription_season"}
%h3 Subscription Season

%p
  The membership year runs from
  %strong 1st September
  to
  %strong 31st August
  and payment of an annual subscription grants membership of the ICU for that period.
%p
  Subscription seasons are often referred to by the 4 digits of the start year plus the last 2 digits of the end year.
  For example, the current season is
  = succeed(".") do
    %strong= Season.new.to_s

%a{name: "how_to_subscribe"}
%h3 How to Subscribe

%p
  Click
  = succeed(",") do
    = link_to t("shop.shop"), shop_path
  click on the type of subscription that suits your circumstances (standard, junior, unemployed, over 65, etc.)
  and then click one of the following buttons:
%ul
  %li
    %strong= t("item.member.me")
    if you're already logged in,
  %li
    %strong= t("item.member.select")
    to lookup an existing member by ID or name,
  %li
    %strong= t("item.member.new")
    to create a new member.
%p
  %strong Important:
  before trying to create a
  %strong new member
  please check that the person isn't already in the ICU database by clicking on
  %strong= t("item.member.select")
  and searching for the person by name. This helps to avoid creating
  %strong duplicate
  ICU IDs. The minimum information you need to create a new member is:
%ol
  %li last name,
  %li first names (middle initials suffice),
  %li full date of birth,
  %li gender,
  %li existing FIDE federation (or desired federation if not already FIDE-registered).
%p
  When you've added all the items you want to pay for, including your subscription, checkout your cart and pay with your credit or debit card.
  Please supply an email address so we can send you a confirmation email.

%a{name: "icu_id"}
%h3 ICU ID

%p
  When you subscribe for the first time you are sent (via the confirmation email) a unique number which is yours for life and
  is used to identify you when, for example, you:
%ul
  %li enter Irish chess tournaments (so your rating can be tracked),
  %li subscribe again in the future (and identify yourself by ID rather than name),
  %li
    = link_to "create a login account", help_accounts_path(anchor: "create_account")
    for the ICU websites (so they can display information relevant to you).

%a{name: "season_ticket"}
%h3 Season Ticket

%p
  This is a short sequence of letters and digits which is proof that a subscription has been paid by a particular member for a particular season.
  A member who is in possession of a valid season ticket can use it to create a login account to the ICU websites. You should keep your season
  tickets secret to avoid someone impersonating you. If you've already got a login account then you don't need a season ticket but unless you
  subscribe each season your account will become inactive and you will ned to re-subscribe in order to re-activate it.
%p
  For any payments that involve subscriptions, the confirmation email includes ICU IDs and season tickets for each subscriber.
  If you're paying subscriptions for other people, please pass on this information in confidence.

%a{name: "grace_period"}
%h3 Grace Period

%p
  In practice many subscribers pay late, even though the
  = link_to "membership bye-laws", icu_membership_byelaws_path
  specify that subscriptions are due on of before September 1st.
  For the purposes of the September rating list and logging into the ICU websites,
  members who subscribed for the previous season are considered to still be members for the months of September to December.
  However, if you still haven't subscribed by January your rating won't be published that month and your logins,
  if you have any, will expire.
%p
  Other organisations who require membership of the ICU to enter their tournaments (such as the Leinster and Munster leagues)
  may or may not have a similar grace period. The safe option is to subscribe promtly.

%a{name: "fide_federation"}
%h3 FIDE Federation

%p
  If you're subscribing for the first time (creating a new ICU ID) and are not yet registered with FIDE you must choose which
  federation you want to belong to for when you play in your first FIDE-rated Irish tournament (some, not all, tournaments in
  Ireland are rated by FIDE as well as the ICU). Federation is the same as country for most people, though please note the Irish
  federation includes Northern Ireland.
%ul
  %li
    If you are
    %strong Irish (or Norther Irish)
    then just choose Ireland as your federation and you will automatically be registered with FIDE after your first FIDE-rated tournament.
  %li
    If you are
    %strong foreign, living in Ireland and want to register as Irish with FIDE
    then choose Ireland for your federation and you will automatically be registered with FIDE after your first FIDE-rated tournament.
    However, please be aware of the following two points:
    %ol
      %li
        there are additional eligibility requirements to represent Ireland as an
        = link_to "adult", icu_eligibility_criteria_path
        or as a
        = succeed(",") do
          = link_to "junior", icu_junior_eligibility_criteria_path
      %li it can be expensive to change federation if you later change your mind.
  %li
    If you are
    %strong foreign and don't want to register as Irish with FIDE
    then choose whatever federation you want. However, you will not be able to play in any FIDE-rated
    tournaments in Ireland without first obtaining a FIDE ID from your chosen federation.
    The Irish rating officer (who reports FIDE-rated Irish tournamants to FIDE) can only register Irish players.

%a{name: "alternative_payment_methods"}
%h3 Alternative Payment Method

%p
  We strongly recommend paying for subscriptions online because of the speed and reliability of computers compared to humans.
  However, if you really can't or won't do this then you may also pay the old fashioned way by sending a cheque in the post.
  Be advised though that you:
%ul
  %li may wait days or even weeks (instead of seconds) for your payment to be processed,
  %li risk your letter getting lost or forgotten about,
  %li will add to the workload of an unpaid volunteer for the ICU.
%p
  If you still insist on paying for subscriptions this way, then as well as your cheque
  and contact details, include the following details per subscriber:
%ul
  %li
    For
    = succeed(":") do
      %strong existing members
  %ul
    %li subscription type,
    %li name,
    %li ICU ID.
  %li
    For
    = succeed(":") do
      %strong new members
  %ul
    %li subscription type,
    %li last name,
    %li first names (initials of middle names is sufficient),
    %li full date of birth,
    %li gender,
    %li FIDE or non-Irish national rating (if one exists),
    %li existing FIDE federation (or desired federation if not already FIDE-registered).
- if @treasurer
  %p
    Send your cheque and the above information to:
    = succeed(".") do
      %strong
        = succeed(",") do
          = @treasurer.name
        = @treasurer.address
    = case @treasurer.gender
      - when "M" then "He"
      - when "F" then "She"
      - else "They"
    will reply with ICU IDs and season tickets for all subscribers.
    If you're paying for other people, pass the information on
    (in confidence, because season tickets are private to each subscriber).
