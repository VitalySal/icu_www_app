%h3 Viewing Data about You

%p
  A small amount of data (ID, name, gender, YOB, federation, chess title and club) is made
  publicly available for all player records in the main ICU database in the

    = link_to "player list", players_path
%p
  To see the full data stored about you, login to this website, find yourself in the player list
  and click your name. Unless you are a user with enhanced access, you can only view full
  data about yourself and not other players.
%p
  In the case of the ratings website, summary data on your tournaments and results is publicly
  available. Detailed calculations relating to your ICU rating are available to any ICU member who
  logs in. Information that can help identify you, such as your DOB (copied to the ratings database
  from the main ICU database) is available to users with enhanced access.

  The names and clubs of members who have paid a subscription for the current and previous
  few seasons are listed publicly in

  and there's also a public list of

  containing names, titles and clubs.

%a{name: "dob"}
%h3 Date of Birth

%p
  Players must supply their full date of birth (DOB) when they become an ICU member. It will be used
  for identification (when players have similar names), rating K-factors, junior and veteran
  eligibility and passed on to FIDE (and stored in their database) when the rating officer registers
  players with them.
%p
  Only year of births (YOBs) are displayed publicly on the ICU websites but DOBs are available to
  users with enhanced access. This is a similar policy to the one FIDE operate for their website.
%p
  You can, if you insist, ask us to remove your DOB from the database after you join but we advise against
  this, especially if you're a junior as it may prevent your selection for international competitions.
  In the current webmaster's experience, only 2 people in the last 10 years have made such a request.

%a{name: "phone_numbers"}
%h3 Phone Numbers

%p
  If you supply any of your phone numbers (home, mobile or work) we will store them in the ICU database
  and may use them to contact you. They will not be published publicly on the web site but will be made
  available to users with enhanced access. Those users may pass on your phone number(s) to other people
  involved in chess organisation (for example, tournament controllers) if they need to contact you urgently.
  If you never want the ICU to contact you by phone then don't supply any numbers or delete the numbers
  that are already stored for you.
%p
  There is one exception to the rule that telephone numbers are never displayed publicly on the website and
  that is if you become an ICU officer. By default, in that case, all your numbers are displayed on the
  = link_to t("icu.officers"), icu_officers_path
  page. If you don't want all (or even any of) your numbers to be displayed there, then there are two solutions.
%ol
  %li
    Completely remove from the database any phone numbers you don't want displayed. The drawback of this option
    is that it hides your numbers from everyone, including ICU officers.
  %li
    The preferred option is to ask the webmaster to mark some or all of your phone numbers as private.
    In that case, only the remaining, non-private numbers (if any) will be displayed on the contacts page
    while all your numbers will still be available to ICU officers.
%p As an ICU officer, it's preferable that you make at least one phone number publicly available for ICU members to call you.
