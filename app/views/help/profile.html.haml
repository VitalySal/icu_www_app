%h3 Profile Data

%p
  The ICU keeps profile data about Irish chess players in it's database.
  Some of this data is publically available (on the websites) and some is
  only for users with restricted access
  (see
  = link_to t("help.privacy"), help_privacy_path
  for details). Some of the data can be updated by players themselves if they have a login account
  while for other changes players need to contact us.
%p
  For various reasons we can't allow players to control all of the data we have about them.
  For example, we need to be contacted about corrections to DOB, gender or federation as
  such corrections would have to be passed on to FIDE.
