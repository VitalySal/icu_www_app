%p
  This help page is for ICU officers, such as the treasurer, who deal with payments and refunds.
  It explains how to search for information on previous purchases and how to make refunds.
  Most of these website features require the user to be logged in as
  = t("user.role.treasurer")
  or
  = succeed(").") do
    = t("user.role.admin")

%a{name: "payment_status"}
%h3= t("help.payment_status")

%p
  Users make online purchases by filling a
  %strong Cart
  with one or more
  %strong Items
  before paying with their credit card.
  Offline purchases are similar except that an ICU officer fills in a cart on behalf of a user (see
  = succeed(").") do
    = link_to t("help.offline_payments"), help_offline_payments_path
  If the payment is successful, the cart and all its items change status from
  %strong= t("shop.payment.status.unpaid")
  to
  %strong= t("shop.payment.status.paid")
  and at that point all items become
  = succeed(".") do
    %strong= t("active")
  For example, if one of the items is a subscription then the person subscribed becomes a paid-up member of the ICU.
%p
  Carts and items can also have a 3rd status of
  %strong= t("shop.payment.status.refunded")
  and carts can have a 4th status of
  %strong= t("shop.payment.status.part_refunded")
  (individual items can only be wholly refunded).
%p
  %em= t("shop.payment.status.paid")
  and
  %em= t("shop.payment.status.part_refunded")
  are
  %strong= t("active")
  statuses while
  %em= t("shop.payment.status.unpaid")
  and
  %em= t("shop.payment.status.refunded")
  are
  = succeed(".") do
    %strong= t("inactive")

%a{name: "make_refund"}
%h3= t("help.make_refund")

%p
  A suitably privileged user (typically the treasurer or webmaster) can refund
  (or revoke - see the next section) one or more items in an active cart as follows:
%ul
  %li Search carts or items to locate and then view the relevant cart (see below).
  %li
    Click the
    = succeed("...") do
      %strong= t("shop.payment.refund")
    button which will bring up a list of items with checkboxes.
  %li
    Check all the items to be refunded and click
    = succeed(".") do
      %strong= t("shop.payment.refund")
%p
  If the original payment was made online then the refund to the payer's credit card
  will be initiated automatically, without any further action required. Depending on
  details of the payer's bank, the process may take some days to complete and the
  refund will not necessarily show up in the payer's statement, instead the original
  payment may simply drop off.
%p
  If the payment was made offline then the refund is also offline, in other words
  arrangements must be made to manually refund the payer (see the section below on revokes).
%p
  The refunded items change status from
  %strong= t("shop.payment.status.paid")
  to
  %strong= t("shop.payment.status.refunded")
  and therefore become
  = succeed(".") do
    %strong= t("inactive")
  For example, if one of the items is a subscription then
  the person subscribed immediately ceases to be a paid-up member.
%p
  The cart to which the refunded items belong also changes status to either
  %strong= t("shop.payment.status.refunded")
  to
  %strong= t("shop.payment.status.part_refunded")
  depending on whether there are any remaining items with status
  = succeed(".") do
    %em= t("shop.payment.status.paid")

%a{name: "make_revoke"}
%h3= t("help.make_revoke")

%p A refund (see previous section) involves two changes:
%ol
  %li an update of records in the ICU database to indicate that one or more items in a cart have been refunded,
  %li an automatic reimbursement to the payer's credit card (via the ICU's payment processor, currently <em>Stripe</em>).
%p
  However, the second change, the automatic reimbursement, is not always possible.
  When the reimbursement has to be done manually (by the ICU sending a cheque, for example)
  then the operation is termed a <b>revoke</b> (rather than a <b>refund</b>).
%p The different scenarios when a refund and/or a revoke is possible are as follows:
%ul
  %li
    Old payments made before
    = t("migration_date")
    that predate the current version of the ICU website can neither be revoked nor refunded.
  %li
    After
    = succeed(":") do
      = t("migration_date")
    %ul
      %li Cash/cheque payments can only be revoked.
      %li Credit/debit card payments can be refunded if they were processed by the current Stripe account.
      %li Credit/debit card payments processed by an old Stripe account can only be revoked.
%p
  See
  = link_to t("help.topics.appendix.stripe"), help_overview_path(anchor: "stripe")
  in the
  = link_to t("help.overview"), help_overview_path
  for why the ICU's Stripe account may sometimes change.
%p
  To perform a revoke the administrative user follows the same set of steps as above for a refund
  except that the button to click will be labelled <em>Revoke</em> rather than <em>Refund</em>.
  The changes to the ICU database are the same for a refund and revoke, the only difference
  is that with a revoke the payer doesn't receive an automatic refund. It's the responsibility of
  the user who revoked the cart item(s) — usually the treasurer — to ensure that the repayment is completed manually.
%p To summarize:
%ul
  %li <b>DO NOT</b> send a manual repayment for a <b>refund</b> as otherwise the payer will be reimbursed twice.
  %li <b>DO</b> send a manual repayment for a <b>revoke</b> as otherwise the payer will not be reimbursed at all.
%p
  In the
  = succeed(",") do
    = link_to_if can?(:view, Refund), "searchable list of previous refunds", admin_refunds_path
  the type (Refund/Revoke) of each item is indicated.

%a{name: "transfer_payment"}
%h3= t("help.transfer_payment")

%p
  This is relevant when people pay for the right thing but for the wrong person.
  An example is when an already existing member erroneously joins as a new member thus creating a duplicate.
  It would be nice if, once such an error is discovered, the payment could be transferred from one ICU ID
  (in the example, the duplicate ID) to the correct one (in the example, the pre-existing member's ID).
  Sadly, in the current implementation, that is not possible.
%p
  The way to handle this type of scenario is to refund the relevant part of the payment
  (in the example, the subscription) and to instruct the payer to try again but this time
  make the correct payment (in the example, resubscribe the existing member).
%p
  In the example scenario, where a duplicate has been created, one more thing needs to be done and
  that is to mark the duplicate record as such. This involves setting its <em>Master ID</em>
  to the ID of the original record and has to be done by the webmaster (the treasurer isn't
  authorized to make such changes).
