  There are some PGN files amongst the

  but the main way of searching for and playing over games
  %em
    (apologies for the delay, the game viewer is not implemented
    yet but should be available before the end of 2014)
  on this website, is via the

  page.

  Like the previous version of this website, a ZIP-compressed PGN file of
  all games in the collection is available for anyone to download.

  Unlike the previous website, there are two other ways to download PGN files
  but only available to members who are signed in (see

  and

    = link_to t("help.accounts")

  This file is regenerated once per day early in the morning but only if there have been any updates to
  the games collection during the previous day. It therefore may be slightly out-of-date for up to 24 hours.
  There will normally be some information next to the link about how many games the file
  contains and when the last update to the collection was at the time the file was last generated.
