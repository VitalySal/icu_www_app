  In the previous version of this website, editors had to write HTML in order to create or edit articles and news items.
  Now, however, it's possible to use
  %strong Markdown
  instead which is much easier. See the
  = link_to "original article", "http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax", target: "markdown"
  and this
  = succeed(".") do
    = link_to "Wikipedia article", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown", target: "markdown"
%p To illustrate the differences between HTML and Markdown, here is that last paragraph written in Markdown:
%pre
  = preserve do
    In the previous version of this website, editors had to write HTML in order to create or edit articles and news items.
    Now, however, it's possible to use **Markdown** instead which is much easier.
    See the [original article](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and
    this [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
%p
  Note the absence of tags for paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;), bold text (&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;) and links (&lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;)
  which would have been required if the same thing was written using HTML.
%p
  Markdown has a deliberately limited syntax and isn't capable of producing arbitrary HTML.
  Even such simple things as an anchor tag or a target attribute in a link have no equivalent in Markdown.
  For this reason, whenever you need something Markdown can't handle, you can always just insert raw HTML.
  For example, here is a header using Markdown syntax along with an associated anchor tag using HTML.
%pre
  = preserve do
    :escaped
      <a name="rook_endings"></a>
      ### Rook Endings
%p
  For articles, although not for news items (which are generally much simpler), you can even turn Markdown processing off
  completely and write entirely in HTML, but this is not recommended unless you really need it.
%p
  Below is a quick summary of Markdown syntax. For futher help and inspiration, try looking at what
  other, more experienced editors have done. Although you can't edit the creations of other editors,
  you can, after logging in as an editor, see their raw input text by cicking the
  %em Source
  button at the bottom of their articles and news items.

%h3 Paragraphs

%p Just enter two newlines to start a new paragraph.
%pre
  = preserve do
    :escaped
      Twas bryllyg, and the slythy toves did gyre and gymble in the wabe.

      All mimsy were the borogoves; and the mome raths outgrabe.

%h3 Headers
%pre
  = preserve do
    :escaped
      # Title Header (equivalent to <h1>)
      ## Section Header (<h2>)
      ### Sub-Section Header (<h3>)

%h3 Text styles
%pre
  = preserve do
    :escaped
      *This text will be italic*
      _This will be underlined_
      **This text will be bold**
      ~~This will be strikethrough~~
      *You **can** combine styles*

%h3 Links
%p Put the link text in square brackets followed by the URL in round brackets. For example:
%pre [Ratings](http://ratings.icu.com)
%p
  See also
  = link_to t("help.shortcuts"), help_shortcuts_path
  for several custom shortcuts developed specifically for this website for quickly inserting various kinds of links.

%h3 Unordered lists
%pre
  = preserve do
    :escaped
      * Item 1
      * Item 2
        * Item 2a
        * Item 2b

%h3 Ordered Lists
%pre
  = preserve do
    :escaped

      1. Item 2
         a. Item 2a
         a. Item 2b

%h3 Inline typewriter text
%pre
  = preserve do
    :escaped
      I think here the move `Nf3` was called for.

%h3 Block quotes
%pre
  = preserve do
    :escaped
      As Emanuel Lasker said:

      > When you see a good move wait:
      > look for a better one

%h3 Images
%p
  Use
  = link_to "IMG", help_shortcuts_path(anchor: "IMG")
  or
  = link_to "IML", help_shortcuts_path(anchor: "IML")
  shortcuts for images.
