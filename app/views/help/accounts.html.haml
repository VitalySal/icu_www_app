  %strong 24 hours
  before changes on this site are reflected on the other site.

%h3 Changing a Login Account

%p
  If you already have a login account but have stopped using the address for sending and receiving emails
  (for example, if it belongs to a company you no longer work for), you don't necessarily need to create a
  new account but can continue to use the old email address just for signing into the ICU websites.
%p
  However, if you would prefer not to have to sign in with your old address then create a new login account
  as described above. The new email address must be a working one as otherwise you won't be able to answer
  the verification message to complete the signup procedure.
